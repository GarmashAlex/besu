# Verkle Trie Implementation in Hyperledger Besu

This document provides an overview of how Verkle tries are implemented in Hyperledger Besu, including both the Java code and any native components. This documentation aims to help new developers get onboarded faster when working with the Verkle trie implementation.

## Overview

Verkle tries are an improvement over Merkle Patricia Tries (MPTs), providing more efficient proofs and storage. The name "Verkle" comes from "Vector commitment" and "Merkle". The primary advantages of Verkle tries include:

1. Significantly smaller proof sizes
2. Improved performance for state access and updates
3. Better scalability for Ethereum state management

## Architecture

The Verkle trie implementation in Besu is organized as follows:

```

## Core Components

### 1. Bandersnatch Elliptic Curve

Verkle tries use the Bandersnatch elliptic curve for cryptographic operations. Bandersnatch is an elliptic curve designed specifically for use in vector commitments, which makes it ideal for Verkle tries.

Key classes:
- `Point.java`: Represents a point on the Bandersnatch curve in projective coordinates
- `PointAffine.java`: Represents a point in affine coordinates (x, y)

### 2. Finite Field Arithmetic

Verkle tries require efficient finite field arithmetic operations. Two primary finite fields are used:

- **Base Field (fp)**: 
  - Implemented in `fp/Element.java`
  - Used for coordinates of points on the elliptic curve
  - Operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, inversion, etc.

- **Scalar Field (fr)**:
  - Implemented in `fr/Element.java`
  - Used for scalars in cryptographic operations
  - Similar interface to the base field, but with different field parameters

### 3. Field Element Implementation

Both finite fields implement elements with the following key operations:

- Basic arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Inversion
- Montgomery form conversion
- Serialization/deserialization
- Comparison operations

## Data Structures

The Verkle trie implementation uses specific data structures for efficiency:

1. **Points**: Represented in both projective coordinates (X:Y:Z) and affine coordinates (x,y)
2. **Field Elements**: Represented using UInt256 for dealing with large integers efficiently
3. **Byte Representation**: Methods to convert between byte arrays and field elements in different endianness

## Key Operations

### Point Operations

- **Point Creation**: Creating points on the curve
- **Point Conversion**: Converting between projective and affine coordinates
- **Serialization**: Converting points to byte representation

### Field Operations

- **Field Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division in finite fields
- **Montgomery Form**: Efficient representation for modular arithmetic
- **Random Element Generation**: Creating random field elements for testing and key generation

## Current Implementation Status

The current implementation focuses on the foundational cryptographic primitives required for Verkle tries:

1. Bandersnatch elliptic curve implementation
2. Finite field arithmetic for both base and scalar fields
3. Point representation and operations

The full Verkle trie implementation including commitment schemes, proof generation, and verification is still under development.

## Integration with Besu

The Verkle trie implementation is designed to eventually replace or complement the existing Merkle Patricia Trie implementation for state storage in Besu. This is part of the broader Ethereum roadmap for scaling and efficiency improvements.

Future versions will integrate with:
- Besu's state management
- Block processing
- Storage layer

## Testing

Tests for the Verkle trie implementation can be found in the corresponding test directories:

```
ethereum/verkletrie/src/test/java/org/hyperledger/besu/ethereum/verkletrie/
```

Tests cover:
- Field element operations
- Point arithmetic
- Curve operations
- Serialization/deserialization

## Future Development

The Verkle trie implementation is part of Ethereum's ongoing development roadmap. Future work includes:

1. Complete trie structure implementation
2. Proof generation and verification
3. Integration with Besu's consensus mechanisms
4. Performance optimizations
5. Support for stateless clients
